## Introduction
falanx: a byzantine broadcast protocol

It is a protocol (naive demo) trying to achieve a Byzantine ordered consensus according to 
[CRYPTO2020 Order-Fairness for Byzantine Consensus](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf) and [OSDI2020 Byzantine Ordered Consensus without Byzantine Oligarchy](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1300.pdf).

Now, we are trying to implement a *Practical Byzantine Ordered Consensus Protocol*, which could achieve order-fairness and avoid Byzantine behavior as far as possible. We call it [*Phalanx*](https://github.com/Grivn/phalanx), regular order for block generation. We would like to propose a practical protocol component which could be combined with all kinds of existing BFT algorithm to achieve *order-fairness* and somehow the *correctness* in both synchronous and asynchronous network.

If you are interested in it, please contact us with e-mail (grivn.wang@gmail.com) or propose issues.

## Summary

 We proposed a brand-new protocol called *Phalanx*. It is an order-fairness byzantine protocol to achieve *order-fairness* property, which is a new kind of BFT property, indicating a trusted order for transactions, introduced by [[4]](#refer-anchor-4). It could become a plugin for most kinds of BFT, which means a traditional protocol, such as PBFT or HotStuff, could complete the *order-fairness* property easily with the accession of *Phalanx*. In addition, *Phalanx* could also be used in asynchronous situation, we would like to propose an asynchronous byzantine protocol, called *Async-Phalanx*, to achieve it.

### Background

Generally, a BFT (*Byzantine Fault Tolerance*) consensus algorithm concentrates on two properties, *safety* and *liveness*. Well, in the system on reality, we should also pay attention to the order of transactions, in which an incorrect order may make the tasks failed. For instance, here is an instant commodity trading system. In such a system, we should send a *trading-transaction* for it if we would like to buy something. After the process of this transaction, the commodity you prefer would be locked. When only one consumer is trying to buy one commodity and sending *trading-transaction*, it is easy to process.  But if there are several people trying to buy one thing at the same time, a concurrency problem will occur, and the order of trading-transactions* could decide who the commodity belongs to. In this situation, the order of transactions would be important for trading fairness.

With most BFT algorithm, especially the partially synchronous protocols, such as PBFT[[1]](#refer-anchor-1) [[2]](#refer-anchor-2) and HotStuff[[3]](#refer-anchor-3), we cannot deal with the problem about fairness of transaction order because of the proposal generation process. In most BFT protocols, a proposal is usually generated by one specific node, and the participants could only detect limited malicious manners of proposer, such as *fork-attack* or *silence-attack*. As the proposer could make a decision on the content of proposals, it could decide the order the transactions on purpose to make some of them failed, which cannot be detected as normal.

So that, in *CRYPTO2020*, [[4]](#refer-anchor-4) introduced a new kind of property for BFT called *order-fairness*, which indicates a trusted order for transactions. The author has also proposed a new class of consensus protocols called Aequitas, which are the first to achieve *order-fairness* in both *synchronous* and *asynchronous* situations.  However, the Aequitas are difficult to implement, and there are not any experiments for the performance of them. To make it more practical, in *OSDI2020*, [[5]](#refer-anchor-5) proposed a consensus protocolcalled Pompe, which could also achieve the *order-fairness* under the partially synchronous BFT protocols, and did some experiments on it. But it is difficult for us to use Pompe in asynchronous situation, as the order of commands in it is decided by *trusted-timestamp*.

### Contributions(a part)

So that, we propose a brand-new protocol called *Phalanx*. It is an order-fairness byzantine fault tolerance protocol to achieve *order-fairness* property. It could become a plugin for most kinds of BFT protocol, which means a traditional BFT protocol could complete the *order-fairness* property easily with the accession of *Phalanx*. In addition, the *Phalanx* protocol could also be used in asynchronous situation, we would like to propose an asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance protocol, called *Async-Phalanx*, to achieve it.
