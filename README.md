# Falanx
## Introduction
falanx: a byzantine broadcast protocol

It is a protocol naive implement trying to achieve a Byzantine ordered consensus according to 
[CRYPTO2020 Order-Fairness for Byzantine Consensus](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf) and [OSDI2020 Byzantine Ordered Consensus without Byzantine Oligarchy](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1300.pdf).

Now, we are trying to implement a *Practical Byzantine Ordered Consensus Protocol*, which could achieve order-fairness and avoid Byzantine behavior as far as possible.
